# Algorithms

This is a project where I will be doing some basic algorithms mostly inspired by courses from [MIT OpenCourseWare](https://ocw.mit.edu/index.htm) like [Introduction to algorithms](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-006-introduction-to-algorithms-fall-2011/) and [Design and Analysis of Algorithm](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-046j-design-and-analysis-of-algorithms-spring-2015/index.htm).

## Sorting

Sortings algorithms are in `sorting.py` file.

If you want to test the algorithms you can run `sorting_test.py` script with the following parameters:
```
-a  Algorithm to test
-l  List of element to be sorted (optional)
-n  The script will create a list of n random elements (optional)
```

You need to pass a list of elements or a number of elements.
